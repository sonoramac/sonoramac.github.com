		<h2>Why doesn't Sonora support OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard?</h2>
		<p class="answer">We believe that the time we would invest in making Sonora Snow Leopard compatible would be far better invested in making it a better and more feature complete product.</p>
		<h2>Is Sonora compatible with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion?</h2>
		<p class="answer">OS X 10.8 is a beta OS and therefore is not completely supported by Sonora at this time. Sonora will fully support Mountain Lion when it is publicly released this summer.</p>
		<h2>Why is there no AirPlay support?</h2>
		<p class="answer">Apple currently does not provide a public API for streaming content via AirPlay from OS X. When an API exists, we will add support for it in Sonora. In the meantime, you can use Rogue Amoeba Software's <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/">Airfoil</a> to stream music from Sonora to AirPlay devices and also other non-Apple hardware.</p>
		<h2>Why doesn't Sonora sync imported music, playcounts, or mixes back to iTunes?</h2>
		<p class="answer">Complete iTunes integration is a very difficult problem to solve, considering the limited amount of access Apple gives for third party applications to use iTunes data. At the moment, Sonora supports syncing songs and playlists from iTunes but does not support syncing back play counts and mixes/playlists that were created from Sonora. We are still working on this problem and hope to come up with a satisfactory solution in a future update. For now, you can import songs and create playlists in iTunes, and Sonora will automatically import them at startup.</p>
		<h2>Why can't Sonora write metadata to iTunes audio files?</h2>
		<p class="answer">The Mac App Store guidelines state that third party applications are not allowed to modify files belonging to other applications. For this reason, metadata edits made to music that was originally imported from iTunes will be local to Sonora only and will not be written to the file itself.</p>
		<h2>Does Sonora support iTunes Match?</h2>
		<p class="answer">Again, Apple does not provide 3rd party apps with APIs to show music stored in iCloud. However, any music that you download from iTunes Match in iTunes will automatically be imported into Sonora at startup.</p>
		<h2>Can I receive a refund?</h2>
		<p class="answer">If you are not satisfied with Sonora, please <a href="#">contact us</a> first and we will do our best to help you resolve your issue. We can not process refunds ourselves, but you may <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/">contact Apple</a> to request one.</p>
